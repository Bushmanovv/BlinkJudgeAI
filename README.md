# BlinkJudgeAI
BlinkJudgeAI is an AI-powered staring contest game where your webcam becomes the arena and the AI is the judge. Using real-time face and eye tracking with OpenCV and MediaPipe, the application detects blinks from up to 4 players simultaneously. The last person to blink wins â€” or gets caught by the AI!
